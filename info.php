	Hello and welcome to <strong>Wild West</strong>, a JavaScript-based competitive environment for simple fight simulations. 
	Bots, simple JavaScript programs, fight against each other following simple yet amusing <a href="rules">rules</a> of 
	a well-known child's game. 
	<br/>
	The main aim of this simulation is to see how well user-developed AIs perform agains other players. 
	Basically everyone can create his own player, following simple <a href="bot">guidelines</a>.
</p>	

<p>
	If you are new to this site, you might be interested in <a href="rules">game rules</a>. The <strong>Wild West</strong> 
	game is normally played by two (or more) players in real life; it is an amusing time-killing dissipation. Fortunately, 
	the rules are so simple that it is pretty easy to create computer programs which follow them and play the game.
	<br/>
	As a quick start, <a href="ai">bot writing guidelines</a> are provided.
</p>

<p>
	The best part of the game is to see players in action. For this purpose, a testing <a href="arena">Arena</a> is ready: 
	just select players and their teams to see how well different AIs fight.
